== Introduction

At link:https://incoresemi.com/[InCore], the use of Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV) is one of the 
superpowers that enables small teams like ours to specify complex 
hardware intuitively and efficiently. 

Like most undergraduate students, I started out designing digital
logic in Verilog, with reference to coding guidelines from professors, 
coursework, and literature.
Back then, specifying designs dealing with parallelism and concurrency in Verilog was 
always challenging due to its structural and timing emphasis on thinking "how" the hardware designs look like instead of "what" rules, conditions and invariants need to be specified to ensure correct behavior.

For example, if you had to implement a FIFO buffer:

- In Verilog, you'd think about the enqueue/dequeue timing, full/empty flags, and explicitly manage the read/write pointers.

- In BSV, you'd write rules like "when not full and enqueue requested, add element" and let the compiler handle the scheduling.

A year ago, as a novice BSV designer at InCore, I decided it would be meaningful
to re-implement the Multi-Dimensional Sorting Algorithm (MDSA) implementation 
from my B.Tech capstone project in a High-Level Hardware Description Language - BSV.

Before addressing the timing and area concerns of this redesign, 
the focus of this work is to evaluate if the BSV counterpart
is cycle-level performant, intuitive to understand, and easy to implement.

More on the taxonomy of sorters, low power methodologies, 
other variants (Hybrid and Odd-Even sorters), and ASIC implementation results
can be referred to in the published paper 
link:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234758[Low Power Multidimensional Sorters using Clock Gating and Index Sorting]. 

My complete MDSA Bitonic Implementation in BSV, along with the legacy 
Verilog implementation, can be found in my 
link:https://github.com/govardhnn/Low_Power_Multidimensional_Sorters[GitHub repository].

TLDR; In this blog, we shall:

. Understand the Multi-Dimensional Sorting Algorithm,
. Use inbuilt BSV Library functions to design an increasing complexity of sorters,
. Sort 64 elements passed as an 8x8 array in six phases,
. Generate verilog, simulate and synthesize the CAE, BM4, BM8 and MDSA Bitonic Sorters,
. And discover a 25% reduction in gate-count (121k to 90k) by comparing the legacy 
Verilog implementation vs the new BSV implementation using a simple optimization!

== Designing the CAE, BM4, BM8 and MDSA Bitonic Sorters in BSV

=== The Compare And Exchange Block

The `Compare And Exchange` (CAE) block is a fundamental building block of Systolic 
Array based Parallel Hardware Sorters which sorts two inputs to an ascending order output.

image::./img/CAE.png[width=40%,title="The Compare and Exchange (CAE) Block"]

- First, we specify the CAE typedef as a Vector of 2 elements of width `WordLength`:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_types.bsv[lines=9..9]

- Then, declare the method ActionValue `mav_get_sort`:

The CAE block checks if `cae_in[0]` is greater than `cae_in[1]` to swap them.

TIP: We can use the inbuilt Vector to Vector `reverse` function to swap the values.  

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/cae.bsv[lines=38..43]

If you're curious what the generated verilog for the CAE looks like,
here's a snippet:

```
    assign mav_get_sort =
            (mav_get_sort_cae_in[31:0] <= mav_get_sort_cae_in[63:32]) ?
            mav_get_sort_cae_in :
            { mav_get_sort_cae_in[31:0], mav_get_sort_cae_in[63:32] } ;
```


=== The Bitonic Sorting Unit

The Bitonic Sorting Unit is a network of 24 such CAE blocks, intricately 
arranged as depicted below. 

image::./img/BM8.png[width=50%,title="The Bitonic Merge Sorting Network"]

This network sorts eight input elements in ascending order at the end of 
six stages.

To read more about the Bitonic Sorting Network, refer to the seminal paper 
on systolic array sorting network design by Batcher[4].

If you look closely, we can take parts of
the above BM8 architecture and modularize them - let's try a BM4 unit. 

=== The BM4 sorter

The BM4 unit, by creating an intermediate two-stage, four-input sorter,
and specify the two methods for input and output as follows:

image::./img/BM4.png[width=10%,title="The BM4 sorter Network"]

- Declare a typedef for `BM4` as a vector of 4 inputs of width `WordLength`:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_types.bsv[lines=11]

- Specify the intermediate pipeline as a register of the BM4 type:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/bm4.bsv[lines=59]

- First stage of sorting with the inputs, by routing the inputs at indices
0 and 3 to `CAE-0`, and 1 and 2 to `CAE-1` block. 

TIP: We use the inbuilt vector function
`vec` to combine multiple elements into a vector:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/bm4.bsv[lines=68..71]

- Perform the second stage sorting with the intermediate sorted values by routing the pipeline outputs at indices
0 and 1 to `CAE-0`, and 2 and 3 to `CAE-1` block:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/bm4.bsv[lines=79..80]

- Return the outputs as:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/bm4.bsv[lines=83..83]

=== The BM8 sorter

Now with the abstraction of using a BM4 sorter, we can proceed to design the
complete Bitonic Merge 8 input sorter as follows:

- Instantiate the 5 intermediate register pipelines:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/bm8.bsv[lines=45..45]

- Pass the inputs through the sorting network defined for each stage of the BM8, 
while storing the intermediate values in the above pipeline registers:

- Stage 1:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/bm8.bsv[lines=124..139]

- Stage 2:

Pass the outputs of the first stage to the BM4 sorter, and register their output
for the third stage:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/bm8.bsv[lines=55..56]

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/bm8.bsv[lines=64..71]

\... and so on for the remaining stages 4 to 6.

Now that we have designed the BM8 sorter, let us move on to using it for the MDSA.

== The Multi-Dimensional Sorting Algorithm

MDSA is used to sort data represented in the form of an N-dimensional matrix based on an FSM that alternates between row and column sorting in each phase. For an 8x8 matrix, the MDSA sorts 64 elements in 6 stages as per the following FSM:

image::./img/MDSA_FSM.png[width=50%,title="The FSM that implements the MDSA"]

=== The MDSA Architecture

The MDSA implementation can efficiently use Parallel Hardware Sorter Arrays(PHSAs) like the Bitonic sorter we earlier designed to specify an architecture that uses eight such units 
to sort 64 elements (8x8) in 6 stages by simply alternating between row and column sorting, and rerouting the order of outputs (ascending/descending). Following is a block diagram of the MDSA architecture:

image::./img/MDSA.png[width=50%,title="The block diagram of the MDSA Architecture"]


Also, now that we are redesigning the MDSA, I desire to implement an optimization where I handle the ascending and descending order of the MDSA inputs at the 
input of the Parallel Sorting Networks and limit myself to using unidirectional CAE blocks.

Note that in the legacy verilog implementation, we had CAE blocks that could support both the directions to simplify the top-level transpose matrix.

IMPORTANT: The reason why I choose to keep the CAEs simple in the new BSV implementation is because selecting between the ascending
and descending increases the number of multiplexors in each CAE block, 
and in the MDSA sorter,
there are 8 (Bitonic Networks) * 24 (CAE blocks in each Network) = 192 CAE blocks which is indeed substantial! + 
Let us later look at the gate-count difference to determine how much this optimization has impacted 
our implementation's area :)


We specify the `MDSA_64` type which is a multidimensional 8x8 vector 

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_types.bsv[lines=17..18]


To create a 64 record register buffer specified as:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_bitonic.bsv[lines=35]

And use this helper function to send inputs to the MDSA sorter network:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_bitonic.bsv[lines=15..27]

==== Stage 1: Column Sorting 

- Sending the inputs to the Eight BM8 sorters:

image::./img/MDSA_FSM_P1.png[width=50%,title="The First Phase of the MDSA"]

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_bitonic.bsv[lines=40..46]

- Collecting the ascending order of responses

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_bitonic.bsv[lines=52..59]

- Transposing the output from Column to Row sorting: 

TIP: We can use the inbuilt Vector to Vector `transpose` function
in BSV to alternate between the row and column sorting between the phases of the MDSA.

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_bitonic.bsv[lines=63]

==== Stage 2: Row Sorting 

- Sending the inputs to the Eight BM8 sorters:

image::./img/MDSA_FSM_P2.png[width=50%,title="The Second Phase of the MDSA"]

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_bitonic.bsv[lines=71..77]

- Collecting the alternating ascending and descending order of responses

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_bitonic.bsv[lines=84..95]

- Transposing the output from Row to Column sorting:

[source,BSV]
include::../bsv/MDSA_bitonic/mdsa_bitonic.bsv[lines=99]

\... and so on for the remaining stages 3 to 6 as per the MDSA FSM.

Ultimately, an ideal test case where all 64 inputs specified in descending order is:

```
[MDSA] STARTING MDSA STAGE 1
[MDSA]: STAGE 1 INPUTS:<V <V 'h00000040 'h0000003f 'h0000003e 'h0000003d 'h0000003c 'h0000003b 'h0000003a 'h00000039  > <V 'h00000038 'h00000037 'h00000036 'h00000035 'h00000034 'h00000033 'h00000032 'h00000031  > <V 'h00000030 'h0000002f 'h0000002e 'h0000002d 'h0000002c 'h0000002b 'h0000002a 'h00000029  > <V 'h00000028 'h00000027 'h00000026 'h00000025 'h00000024 'h00000023 'h00000022 'h00000021  > <V 'h00000020 'h0000001f 'h0000001e 'h0000001d 'h0000001c 'h0000001b 'h0000001a 'h00000019  > <V 'h00000018 'h00000017 'h00000016 'h00000015 'h00000014 'h00000013 'h00000012 'h00000011  > <V 'h00000010 'h0000000f 'h0000000e 'h0000000d 'h0000000c 'h0000000b 'h0000000a 'h00000009  > <V 'h00000008 'h00000007 'h00000006 'h00000005 'h00000004 'h00000003 'h00000002 'h00000001  >  >
```

Shall be sorted in 6 stages to ascending order as follows:

```
Final MDSA output: <%h><V <V 'h00000001 'h00000002 'h00000003 'h00000004 'h00000009 'h0000000a 'h0000000b 'h0000000c  > <V 'h00000005 'h00000006 'h00000007 'h00000008 'h0000000d 'h0000000e 'h0000000f 'h00000010  > <V 'h00000011 'h00000012 'h00000013 'h00000014 'h00000019 'h0000001a 'h0000001b 'h0000001c  > <V 'h00000015 'h00000016 'h00000017 'h00000018 'h0000001d 'h0000001e 'h0000001f 'h00000020  > <V 'h00000021 'h00000022 'h00000023 'h00000024 'h00000029 'h0000002a 'h0000002b 'h0000002c  > <V 'h00000025 'h00000026 'h00000027 'h00000028 'h0000002d 'h0000002e 'h0000002f 'h00000030  > <V 'h00000031 'h00000032 'h00000033 'h00000034 'h00000039 'h0000003a 'h0000003b 'h0000003c  > <V 'h00000035 'h00000036 'h00000037 'h00000038 'h0000003d 'h0000003e 'h0000003f 'h00000040  >  >
Verilog simulation finished
```

== Steps to generate verilog and run simulations of the CAE, BM4, BM8 and MDSA_Bitonic:

. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/govardhnn/Low_Power_Multidimensional_Sorters.git

. Navigate to the build directory of the BSV collateral

    cd bsv/build

. Modify the `makefile.inc` to select the module to simulate

For CAE/BM4/BM8/MDSA:

    TB_BSV:= cae_testbench / bm4_testbench / bm8_testbench / mdsa_bitonic_testbench

. To run the simulation with the Bluespec Compiler (bsc):
    
    make all_vsim

The generated verilog can be found in the `verilog_dir` directory

NOTE: To get a vcd dump of the simulation, rerun the executable with the +bscvcd argument.
E.g.  ./mk_mdsa_bitonic_testbench_vsim +bscvcd
Or, add the +bscvcd flag to the `v_simulate` target in the Makefile

== Observations

=== Does this new design meet the timing specification? 

Given each clock cycle is 10ns (Freq: 100MHz) for this simulation,

Inputs provided to the MDSA at [15ns] 

    [15][MDSA] STARTING MDSA STAGE 1
    [15][MDSA]: STAGE 1 INPUTS:<V <V 'h00000040 'h0000003f ... 'h00000002 'h00000001  >  >

takes 6 cycles -> 60ns more to complete sorting at [75ns]

    [75][MDSA]: STAGE 1 DONE
    [75][MDSA]: STAGE 1 OUTPUTS:<V <V 'h00000039 'h0000003a ... 'h00000007 'h00000008  >  >

Taking a dedicated 10ns for the transpose matrix, the complete operation of 
sorting 64 numbers would take: (70ns x 6) 420ns from the start of the simulation(15ns) which is 435ns. 

    [435][MDSA] DONE. Returning outputs:<V <V 'h00000001 'h00000002 ... 'h0000003f 'h00000040  >  >

Hence, we have proven the timing specification level correctness of this design, let us compare 
the line-count and gate-count efficiencies.

=== How many lines of BSV did this take?

In the BSV implementation of the MDSA

     46 cae.bsv
     87 bm4.bsv
    153 bm8.bsv
    246 mdsa_bitonic.bsv
    
Total lines of BSV written: 532

Which generates the following verilog modules

    66  mk_cae.v
    171 mk_bm4.v
    575 mk_bm8.v
    829 mk_mdsa_bitonic.v 

Total lines of Verilog generated: 1641

TIP: You can disable the $display statements from being generated in the verilog generation phase by removing the define `-D DISPLAY` in the Makefile

=== Finally, the Gate-Count Comparison:

NOTE: We shall be using the open-source synthesis tool link:https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys[Yosys], and the scripts can be found in `bsv/build/synth.ys` and `verilog/MDSA_bitonic/synth.ys`

==== Legacy Verilog MDSA synthesis

To run synth of the legacy Verilog MDSA codebase with top module `MDSA_top`:

    cd verilog/MDSA_bitonic

and run:

    yosys -s synth.ys

And we shall find that the synthesis gate count is:

    Number of wires:             143051
    Number of wire bits:         247433
    Number of public wires:        1674
    Number of public wire bits:   56173
    Number of memories:               0
    Number of memory bits:            0
    Number of processes:              0
    Number of cells:             121574

==== BSV MDSA synthesis

NOTE: We shall be running synthesis on the
verilog generated from the BSV explained in this blog. 

You can run a yosys synth at the `bsv/build` with top module `mk_mdsa_bitonic`

    cd bsv/build
    make yosys_synth

And the synthesis gate count is:

    Number of wires:             108735
    Number of wire bits:         243796
    Number of public wires:        2576
    Number of public wire bits:  101182
    Number of memories:               0
    Number of memory bits:            0
    Number of processes:              0
    Number of cells:              90410


_There you go! A reduction in gate-count from *121k* to *90k*._ A staggering *25%* reduction in the total number of cells.

== Scope of future contributions to this project

- Implementing the Hybrid and Odd Even Sorter designs in BSV - which is pretty fun and replicable looking at the current BSV implementation of the Bitonic Sorter and referring to papers [4] and [6].

- Deep-dive into the logic that changed between the legacy Verilog MDSA and the 
new BSV redesign of the MDSA.

- Implement Index Sorting for the Sorting Networks in BSV referring to [1] and [7].

- Understand the generated verilog from each module in BSV, and try to find scope for optimizing area and timing.
