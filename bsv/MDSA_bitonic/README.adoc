	 1. CAE (Compare And Exchange block)
       	    This is a purely combinational circuit that sorts two inputs (a and b) to ascending order
	 2. BM2 Unit
       	    A 4 input Bitonic Merge Unit that contains 6 CAE blocks, arranged in a network such that the four inputs pass through three pipelined stages before providing the final sorted output
