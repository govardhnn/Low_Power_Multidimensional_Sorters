=== Why I rewrote my capstone project (The MDSA implementation) in Bluespec System Verilog

This document outlines the motivation to using Bluespec System Verilog for Hardware design, 
with emphasis on dealing with concurrency beautifully using guarded atomic actions.

A little bit of background here. My first ever major hardware design was the 
implementation of the Multi-Dimensional Sorting Algorithm, 
along with my Capstone team in my bachelors final year. 
We designed the complete module in Verilog, and the micro-architecture of the
MDSA can be referred from our paper:link:[], 

I shall provide insights into how the same design when represented
in guarded atomic actions in BSV proves a much more effecient way of thinking
about designing complex micro-architectures dealing with parallelism, concurrency
and helps use high levels of abstraction.
